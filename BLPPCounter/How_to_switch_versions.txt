How to switch versions:
	Step 1: Go to the "properties" of the project, and under the tab "Build", find the textbox "Conditional Compilation Symbols". Depending on the version,
	do one of the following:
		1.37.0 or above: Enter "NEW_VERSION" into the textbox.
		1.34.2 or below: Make sure the textbox is empty.
	Once this is done, make sure to save.
	Step 2: Go to the file "BLPPCounter.csproj.user". Inside, you should find a regex string in a comment (or you can take it from here: "(?<=\\)(?:\d+\.){2}\d+").
		- Press ctrl+f, paste in the regex code, press alt+e to enable regex mode, Open find and replace mode, type in the version you would like, and press replace all.
